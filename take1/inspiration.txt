     Sector 32:
        It's amazing, however it's a skill issue
            that i cannot replicate even a single
            part of the website.
        Would be wonderful to steal something 
            from it, but I heavily doubt that 
            I can do that at this moment.
    
    Fahru: 
        I think I want to do some kind of 
            Console-Based website.
        Maybe some where you have a login
            feature, however when you insert 
            your username, it will crash
            and everything will go chaos.
        Then it will grant you access.
